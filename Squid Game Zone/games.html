        <img src="Images/Game 1.jpg" alt="Red Light, Green Light">
        <h3>Red Light, Green Light</h3>
        <p>Players must move forward when "Green Light" is announced and freeze completely when "Red Light" is called. A giant doll scans for movement after the command. Anyone caught moving is instantly eliminated.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="Images/Game 2.jpg" alt="Dalgona">
        <h3>Dalgona</h3>
        <p>Players have to cut out a shape from a piece of honeycomb candy using just a small needle. The shapes can be simple like a triangle or really hard like an umbrella. If the candy breaks outside the shape, the player is eliminated.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="Images/Game 3.jpg" alt="Tug of War">
        <h3>Tug of War</h3>
        <p>Players are split into two teams and must pull on a rope to drag the other team off a high platform. It’s not just about strength the timing and teamwork really matter. If your team loses, you fall to your death and get eliminated.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="Images/Game 4.jpg" alt="Marbles">
        <h3>Marbles</h3>
        <p>Players are paired up and given ten marbles each. They must play any marble game of their choice, trying to win all of their partner’s marbles. The twist is only one player can survive so it becomes a heartbreaking fight between friends.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="Images/Game 5.png" alt="Glass Bridge">
        <h3>Glass Bridge</h3>
        <p>Players have to cross a bridge made of glass panels. Some panels are strong, but others are fragile and will break under weight. It’s a test of luck and courage as one wrong step could lead to falling and getting eliminated.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <img src="Images/Game 6.jpg" alt="Final Squid Game">
        <h3>Final Squid Game</h3>
        <p>In the final game, Squid Game, the remaining players face a deadly version of a childhood game on a squid-shaped court. The rules seem easy but it’s all about using strategy, strength, and surviving. Only one can win and the rest are eliminated.</p>
